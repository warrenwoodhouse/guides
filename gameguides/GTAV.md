About the Game

The game itself is set in the year 2012 and in what
seems to be a modern refreshed look of what San Andreas
was suppose to be. The game is now not limited to one
protagonist - but three. You get to play as three different
criminals who are forced together by extreme odds who decide
to use all their knowledge as criminals to steal, kill and
make-do with tons of cash by robbing the local police
departments, businesses and banks within the state.

The criminals are on the HUD as:
* [Michael De Santa/Michael Townley](#mis1) and you regain control as him in [Mission 4](#mis4) - blue
* [Franklin Clinton](#mis2) - green
* [Trevor Philips](#mis1) and you regain control as him in [Mission 15](#mis15) - orange
* [Yourself](#gtao-mis1) and you regain control as him/her when you are playing online (Grand Theft Auto Online only) - yellow

Three different criminals with their own unique personality, clothing style, unlockables, missions, vehicles and skills.
This game has not got three islands anymore - just one really large one and lots of smaller branching islands which you
can access at the start of the game after the first and second mission (mis1 and mis2 in my guide). The game has not got
three cities either - just one. Although, nowadays Los Santos is much larger than it used to be, you can now visit different
landscapes, areas, places and, yes, you can also visit Mt. Chiliad which is now much larger than it used to be.

Good news is, there is more to do in this game than the previous titles. You can also switch to a different character at
anytime, access different locations, purchase properties and do side-missions to earn extra cash, help out random
pedestrians (in this game, it's known as "Strangers & Freaks") and so much more. Plus, on top of all of that, you now don't get
nagging friends asking if you want to go bowling while you are away from the area they are calling in. You're friendship with your
contacts nolonger falls. You can, call them up and ask if they want to go somewhere instead.

All this and more is explained throughout this guide from this point onwards. I welcome you to San Andreas. Have a nice stay!

COVER BLURB (sec:abt:gme:cvrblrb)
ROCKSTAR GAMES PRESENTS
A ROCKSTAR NORTH PRODUCTION

Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an
era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals risk everything in a
series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

*NOTE: This section titled COVER BLURB has all the information from the back cover of the game cover for the XBOX 360 UK
Edition version. Although, this note here is not on the cover though. Also shown on the back cover and I'm not sure if
anyone else noticed it either, but the old GTA 2 logo is shown near the bottom right of the back cover only with the
numeric 2 missing. This, I think, symbolises the GTA family products placeholder.*

INTRODUCTION TITLES/OPENING CREDITS (sec:abt:gme:introcrdts)
Read the section mis1:crdts for the full list of developers, etc. mentioned at the start of the opening titles.

OUTRODUCTION TITLES/END CREDITS (sec:abt:gme:outrocrdts)
Read the section mis69:crdts for the full list of developers, etc. mentioned at the start of the ending titles.

CURRENCY (sec:abt:gme:currency)
The US Dollar Bill marked by the symbol as $, is the currency of the United States Of America and is considered
to be legal tender for all transactions. When on GTA Online, the currency is marked as US Dollar Bill in the symbol
of the US Dollar Bill as GTA$, represents online currency or virtual currency, which is also used to pay for
transactions aswell.

You can always see how much cash you have available by going to any available ATM, by going onto the stock exchange
websites at www.lcn-exchange.com and at www.bawsaq.com, by viewing it on the overview page on GTA Online, by pausing
the game and viewing the amount of funds available in the top right corner and by playing the game as normal and by
pressing v on the d-pad when walking during free-roam or story mode.

If you need quick cash, you can rob a local shop (you'll need to be in a mask), do heist jobs during story mode, do
heist jobs during GTA Online, by completing certain missions, by killing pedestrians (and then taking their money),
by completing taxi jobs, towing jobs around San Andreas or by manipulating the stock exchange in your favor to earn
tons of money.

Even if you have completely ran out of cash, certain expenses will continue being paid each month such as businesses
you own will give you your share of the business profits.

FEATURES (sec:abt:gme:features)
These are the features, shown below:

CHARACTER SWITCHING (sec:abt:gme:features:characterswitching)
In this guide, it's also referred to as Quick-Switch, Switch or Character Switch.
Grand Theft Auto V features 3 playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor - and
many missions are tackled by 2 or 3 of them together, with the ability to switch between
the characters mid-action as they work as a team to get the job done.

Off mission, Michael, Franklin and Trevor each go about separate lives with their own
friends, hobbies and sidelines, giving the player the choice to experience and explore
San Andreas from 3 very different perspectives; for the voyeur in all of us, the freedom
to switch between them in Real-Time at any point to see what they've been up to.

Your 4th character slot at the bottom is reserved for your custom Grand Theft Auto Online
player character - you can make either a man or a woman, the choice of customization is
endless.

PLAYER STATS (sec:abt:gme:features:playerstats)
Michael, Franklin and Trevor start with different Player Stats based on their backstory and
skillset. Each of these stats can be improved with experience, which will in turn improve
each character's individual abilities, reactions and endurance as they progress through
the game. The more a character uses a skill, the more his related stats will increase.
For example, if Michael spends time flying a helicopter, his Flying stat will increase.

*NOTE: Player Stats are unique to each character - spending alot of time behind the wheel
as Franklin will increase Franklin's Driving stat, but won't have any effect on Michael
or Trevor's Driving stat.

The following stats are:
> Special: Using a character's Special Ability will gradually improve their Special stat.
As the stat bar increases, the speed at which that character's Special Ability bar fills up
will also increase.
> Stamina: Extra Stamina will allow the character to sprint, swim and cycle for longer
without getting tired. The Stamina stat will increase as the player performs each of those
activities.
> Shooting: A higher Shooting stat will make the character more accurate by reducing recoil
while Shooting any gun. He will also be able to reload faster and carry more ammunition.
The more targets the player hits, particularly with headshots, the more his Shooting stat
will increase. Spend time in the Shooting Range and take on Shooting Challenges as a fast
way of improving this skill.
> Stength: Additional Strength will inflict heavier damage during hand-to-hand combat,
increase speed at climbing ladders, decrease the amount of damage taken from falls, car
crashes, explosions, fire and improve the character's Tennis and Golf by allowing him to
hit the ball harder. Engaging in unarmed combat, taking part in sports like Tennis, Golf
and Yoga will raise the character's Strength.
> Stealth: The higher the Stealth stat is, the quieter the character will be in both
Stealth, normal movement modes and he'll also be able to move more quickly in Stealth Mode.
The Stealth stat will increase the more time you spend moving in Stealth or by performing
Stealth takedowns. Press LEFT STICK to enter Stealth Mode.
> Flying: When the character has a low Flying stat, the performance of any aircraft he is
Flying will be more susceptible to the effects of turbulence. As the stat increases, the
character will be able to both Fly and land more smoothly. Increasing the Flying stat will
improve the character's ability to Fly all aircrafts. Spending more time Flying will
improve the Flying stat. Visit the Flight School to help improve this stat.
> Driving: Improving the Driving stat will improve the character's vehicle handling when
airborne and will also make performing wheelies much easier. The more time the character
spends Driving vehicles, the faster the Driving stat will improve, particularly performing
wheelies and landing big jumps on 4 wheels.
> Lung Capacity: Having a high Lung Capacity means the character can stay submerged
underwater for longer. Lung Capacity will increase as the character spends more time
underwater.

SPECIAL ABILITIES (sec:abt:gme:features:specialabilities)
Michael, Franklin and Trevor each has his own unique Special Ability. To activate a
Special Ability, press LEFT STICK+RIGHT STICK simultaneously. Beneath the mini-map there
is a Special Ability bar showing how much Special Ability the character has left (see HUD).
The Special Ability bar fills up when certain actions are taken, which vary from player
to player.

MICHAEL'S SPECIAL ABILITY
Michael is an expert marksman with lightning reactions in a gunfight. His Special Ability
slows down time in a gunfight allowing him to pick off his targets with greater ease.
Increase Michael's Special Ability bar by driving at high speeds, performing lethal moves
such as headshots and stealth takedowns.

FRANKLIN'S SPECIAL ABILITY
Franklin is a skilled driver with sharp reflexes behind the wheel. His Special Ability
allows him to slow down time while driving any road vehicle allowing him to quickly
navigate through traffic with ease and take corners at high speed. Time spent driving at
high speeds, narrowly avoiding collisions and driving against traffic will increase his
Special Ability bar.

TREVOR'S SPECIAL ABILITY
Trevor is a drug-addled sociopath with a short fuse. His Special Ability sends him into a
rage, during which he causes double damage to enemies and grants him invincibility. Killing
targets, performing headshots, driving at high speeds and taking damage increase his
Special Ability bar.
